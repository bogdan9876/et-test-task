## Features:
1. If a product is already in the basket and we add it through the catalog, its quantity increases.

3. If the product is already in the basket, we can go to the product page by clicking on the name or on the picture.
4. The sorting feature of the store on the left and the slider also work, and the search on the top right also works.
